<p>Stream Three Project: Data Centric Development - Code Institute<p>

<p> This is a web application that allows users to store and access Movies. 
There is a robust non-relational database schema hosted on MongoDB.
 A backend code that groups and summarises the movies on the site, 
 based on their attributes and a frontend page to show this summary.
  Using Python and Flask the backend code will retrieve a list of movies, descriptions,
  trailers and more.
   There is a detailed view for each movie, that would just show all attributes for that movie,
    and full information about that specific movie. Users can edit and delete their own movie records.
